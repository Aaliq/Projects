This is a raw implementation of a batch script to control your mobile device if the screen is broken
This needs USB debugging turned on
Execute the batch script called Dynamic Display.bat
There are 2 modes Wired and Wireless
Wired mode is pretty self explanatory
Wireless mode still requires the phone to be connected via a USB cable in the beginning to put it into wireless mode, but later it can be unplugged.
